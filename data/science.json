This number dropped to 14 species in the plot with 50 loosestrife plants, and further down to 6 species in the plot with 200 loosestrife plants. This clear pattern shows that as the presence of loosestrife increases, the number of native species decreases. The term \"correlated\" is scientifically accurate here.\nThe other options are less accurate. B is an overgeneralization; this study only looked at one invasive species, so we cannot make a conclusion about all of them. C is a correct calculation (25 starting species - 6 remaining = 19 lost), but it only describes a single data point (Plot C) rather than the overall conclusion of the study. D is also a correct calculation ((25-14)/25 = 44%), but it uses the word \"caused.\" In science, correlation does not automatically prove causation, so \"correlated\" (as in option A) is a more cautious and accurate conclusion."

The decline in biodiversity in Plot C could have been caused by poor soil, not just by competition with the loosestrife, creating uncertainty about the specific cause.\nThe other options are incorrect. B (the one-year duration) might limit long-term conclusions, but it doesn't specifically create uncertainty about the mechanism of competition. C is incorrect because the study was about plant biodiversity, so not testing animals is not a flaw in its design relative to its hypothesis.

A sprint is a short, all-out burst of \"extreme physical exertion,\" which, as the passage describes, relies on anaerobic fermentation for \"rapid\" energy. A marathon is a very long event, requiring a steady, highly efficient energy supply. This is the role of aerobic respiration, which produces \"large amounts of ATP\" and avoids the buildup of fatiguing lactic acid.\nThe other options are incorrect. A is backward; the marathoner relies on aerobic respiration to avoid lactic acid and fatigue, while the sprinter's muscles produce a lot of it in a short time. C is incorrect because the energy needs of the two activities are vastly different and rely on different primary systems.

Vega's temperature of 9,600°C is cooler than Rigel's (12,000°C) but hotter than Betelgeuse's (3,200°C). Therefore, its characteristics should also fall in between.

A is wrong because at 9,600°C, Vega would be much hotter and bluer than Betelgeuse. B is wrong because Vega is cooler than Rigel, so it would be less blue and have a longer peak wavelength.

If the pressure in the lab were to change significantly during the experiment, it would alter the boiling points of all the liquids, making it impossible to know if the observed differences were due to the salt concentration or the pressure change. Therefore, to ensure a valid test, the atmospheric pressure must be kept constant.\nThe other options are incorrect. A (the amount of salt) is the independent variable—the very thing being tested and intentionally changed, not kept constant. C (the time to boil) is a dependent variable—a result that is measured, not controlled. D is incorrect; for a fair comparison, the starting volume of liquid in each beaker should be the same."

The passage explains that the carbon cycle involves a balance between processes that remove CO₂ (like photosynthesis) and processes that release it (like respiration). It then states that fossil fuels are \"long-term carbon stores\" and burning them \"rapidly releases vast quantities of CO₂.\" This action takes carbon that was stored underground (in the geosphere) for millions of years and puts it into the atmosphere at a rate that is far too fast for natural removal processes like photosynthesis to keep up. This imbalance is the core of the disruption.\nThe other options are incorrect. A violates the law of conservation of mass; the total amount of carbon on Earth is constant. C is the opposite of what is happening to atmospheric CO₂. D is incorrect; while some plants benefit from more CO₂, it is not nearly enough to offset the massive emissions."

When exposed to the exact same virus a month later, these memory cells recognized it immediately and launched a rapid, powerful attack that eliminated the virus before it could cause sickness.\nThe other options are incorrect. A describes the innate system, which does not provide specific \"memory\" of past infections. C is not a primary function of the circulatory system. D (skin) is the first-line barrier, but it cannot explain immunity after an initial infection has already occurred."

        "content": "A well-designed experiment must be reproducible; other scientists should be able to follow the same procedure and obtain similar results. To achieve this, a scientist must clearly define all variables and control all factors that are not being tested. For instance, in an experiment testing the effect of fertilizer on plant growth, a vague instruction like \"water the plants regularly\" is poor design. A specific instruction like \"give each plant 50 mL of water every 48 hours\" is necessary for reproducibility.",

        "It introduces a lack of control and makes the experiment impossible for another researcher to reproduce accurately.",
        "Coffee is not known to have any effect on memory, so the experiment is pointless.",

      "correctLetter": "A",
      "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The passage highlights that reproducibility is a cornerstone of good science, and it requires that procedures be described with specificity. The phrase \"some coffee\" is hopelessly vague. It doesn't specify the amount, the concentration of caffeine, the type of coffee, or the timing of administration. This \"lack of control and makes the experiment impossible for another researcher to reproduce accurately.\" If other scientists cannot repeat the experiment, the results cannot be verified and are therefore scientifically weak.\nThe other options are incorrect. B is a biased assumption; the goal of the experiment is to test the claim. C is a false generalization; memory tests are standard cognitive tools. D is another potential flaw, but A points to a critical weakness in the methodology itself as described."

      "question": "After calculating the mean (134 lbs), median (132.5 lbs), and mode (125 lbs), the farmer notices the mode is significantly lower than the other measures. Why is the mode likely a poor representation of the \"typical\" sheep in this case?",
      "options": [
        "The mode is always the least accurate measure of central tendency.",
        "The most frequent weight (125 lbs) happens to be one of the lowest values in the dataset and doesn't reflect the overall distribution of weights.",
        "The flock is too small to have a meaningful mode.",
        "The mean and median are incorrect because they are higher than the mode."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "correctLetter": "B",
      "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The mode is the most frequently occurring value in a dataset. In this case, the mode is 125 lbs. However, when looking at the entire set of weights (ranging from 120 to 160 lbs), it's clear that 125 is on the lower end of the scale. Most of the sheep (7 out of 10) weigh 125 lbs or more. The mean (134) and median (132.5) are much more centrally located within the full range of data. Therefore, the mode is a poor representation of the \"typical\" sheep because it happens to be the most common weight but doesn't reflect the overall distribution, which includes several much heavier animals.\nThe other options are incorrect. A is not a rule; the mode can sometimes be very useful. C is not necessarily true; a mode can be meaningful in a small dataset. D is incorrect; the mean and median are calculated correctly and are better representations of the central tendency in this particular skewed dataset."
