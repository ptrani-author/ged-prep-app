Sentence (8) lists several positive benefits of vertical farming (uses less water, no pesticides, year-round growth). Sentence (9) starts by acknowledging a negative drawback (\"the initial investment... is high\") but then argues that the benefits are more important (\"far outweigh the challenges\").\n•\tA, C, and D are incorrect because this specific structure of \"here are the good things, and while there's one bad thing, the good things are better\" is best described by choice B."

(2) A meta-analysis by Harris Cooper in 1996, which reviewed 39 different studies, found that students, on average, lose about one month of grade-level equivalency in math skills over the summer. (3) Low-income students are disproportionately affected, with some losing up to three months of reading comprehension skills. (4) By replacing the long summer vacation with several shorter breaks distributed throughout the year, a year-round calendar mitigates this academic regression, ensuring students retain more information and teachers have to spend less time on review at the start of each school year.\n(5) This model not only addresses learning loss but also offers logistical benefits. (6) For instance, overcrowded districts can use a multi-track year-round calendar where different groups of students attend school on a staggered schedule, allowing a single school building to accommodate up to 33% more students. (7) This is a far more cost-effective solution than the massive capital outlay required to build new schools. (8) While some parents object to the disruption of traditional family vacation schedules, the academic and financial benefits of year-round schooling present a clear and powerful case for reforming our outdated school calendar.

A powerful solution to this problem is a program of mandatory national service for all young adults. Upon turning 18, every citizen would be required to dedicate one year to serving the country, either through military enlistment or civilian work in sectors like education, infrastructure, or environmental conservation.\nThis shared experience would act as a great equalizer. A young person from a wealthy suburb would work alongside someone from a struggling inner city, and a farmer's child would team up with the child of a tech executive. They would learn to rely on one another to achieve common goals, breaking down stereotypes and fostering a sense of shared national identity. Furthermore, a national service program would provide our communities with a massive infusion of labor to tackle pressing needs, from rebuilding crumbling bridges to assisting in understaffed public schools. It is an investment that would pay dividends for generations by creating more engaged, empathetic, and united citizens.\n\nThe Unjust Burden of Mandatory Service\nThe idea of mandatory national service, while seemingly noble, is fundamentally at odds with the principle of individual liberty. Forcing every 18-year-old to dedicate a year of their life to a government-mandated program is a form of conscription that infringes upon personal freedom. An individual at that age should be free to pursue higher education, enter the workforce, or start a family without the state compelling them into service.\nMoreover, the logistical and financial burden of such a program would be staggering. A 2020 study by the Congressional Budget Office estimated that a national service program for just one million participants—far less than the total number of 18-year-olds—would cost taxpayers over $30 billion annually. This is a massive expenditure for a program with unproven benefits.

Forcing every 18-year-old to dedicate a year of their life to a government-mandated program is a form of conscription that infringes upon personal freedom. An individual at that age should be free to pursue higher education, enter the workforce, or start a family without the state compelling them into service.\nMoreover, the logistical and financial burden of such a program would be staggering. A 2020 study by the Congressional Budget Office estimated that a national service program for just one million participants—far less than the total number of 18-year-olds—would cost taxpayers over $30 billion annually. This is a massive expenditure for a program with unproven benefits.
