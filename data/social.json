      "correctLetter": "B",
      "explanation": "•\tCorrect Answer (B): The passage directly discusses concepts that are central to the natural rights philosophy. John Locke writes about a \"law of nature\" that gives all people inherent rights like \"life, health, liberty, or possessions\" which exist even before government does. This is the definition of natural rights.\n•\tIncorrect Answers:\n\to\tA: The rule of law means everyone, including the government, must obey the law. While a related democratic principle, the main focus of this specific passage is on where our rights come from (nature), not on the application of laws to everyone.\n\to\tC: Checks and balances refer to the division of power among government branches (like the president, Congress, and courts). Locke's text doesn't mention different branches of government.\n\to\tD: Federalism is the division of power between a national government and state governments. This specific passage does not discuss that power-sharing arrangement."

Clarence Earl Gideon was charged with a felony in Florida. At his trial, he appeared in court without a lawyer because he could not afford one. He requested that the court appoint one for him, but under Florida law at the time, counsel was only appointed for poor defendants in capital cases. Gideon was forced to represent himself and was found guilty. He appealed his conviction to the Supreme Court, arguing that he had been denied his constitutional right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment. In a unanimous decision, the Court agreed with Gideon, ruling that the Constitution requires states to provide defense attorneys to criminal defendants who cannot afford to hire their own. This decision extended the Sixth Amendment's right to counsel to all felony cases in state courts.",

        "content": "In response to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the U.S. Congress passed the USA PATRIOT Act. The act's proponents argued that it was a necessary tool to enhance the ability of law enforcement and intelligence agencies to track and disrupt terrorist plots. It expanded the government's authority to conduct surveillance of phone and internet communications, to obtain business and financial records, and to monitor suspected terrorists. However, the act was also highly controversial. Critics, including civil liberties organizations, argued that its provisions went too far, infringing on the privacy rights guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment. They contended that some measures gave the government sweeping powers with insufficient judicial oversight, creating a risk of abuse that could target ordinary citizens. The debate over the PATRIOT Act highlights the persistent tension between ensuring national security and protecting individual freedoms.",

At a price of $4, consumers demand 800 Widgets, but producers are only willing to supply 400 Widgets. This means demand is higher than supply. The difference (800 - 400 = 400) represents a shortage of 400 Widgets.\n•\tIncorrect Answers:\n\to\tA: Equilibrium occurs at $6, not $4.\n\to\tB: A surplus occurs when supply is greater than demand (e.g., at $8).
